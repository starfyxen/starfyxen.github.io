			<h1>Comic Book Mobile</h1>
			<p>I was inspired by Scott Mccloud's ICST and his "trail-based" comic style as it was, as he describes it, a radical departure from traditionally printed comics. I thought that it was interesting how he was trying to break free from the confines of the rectangular page while still trying to keep order by creating a line that viewers could follow and not get lost.</p>
			<p>This is why I decided to go one step further and take the digital ICST out of the screen and make it real.</p>
